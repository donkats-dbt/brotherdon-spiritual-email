			Why Daily Spiritual and Inspirational Messages Matter<br><br>
			In a world filled with uncertainty, noise, and distraction, the soul needs daily nourishment just as the body needs daily bread. A timely word of hope, a verse of Scripture, or a message of encouragement can lift the weary, strengthen the discouraged, and realign our hearts with God’s truth and love. <br><br>
			This ministry is offered at no cost to you without subscriptions fees, or strings attached made possible through faith, love, and the generous support of those who believe in the mission. Brother Don recently diagnosed with Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis and is on a mission to continue spreading GOD’s word. <br><br>
			These messages are more than words, they are reminders that you are not alone, that God is with you, and that each day is a new chance to walk in faith, peace, and purpose. <br><br>
